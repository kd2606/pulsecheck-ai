Provide a JSON response with:
1. "wellnessScore": a wellness score from 0-100 (100 being optimal wellness, inversely proportional to the distress score, poor sleep/diet, and voice biomarkers).
2. "riskCategory": exactly one of: "Routine Support Needed", "Elevated Stress Profile", or "High Wellness Priority".
3. "perceivedState": a brief, accurate description of their perceived emotional or energetic state.
4. "summary": a compassionate, supportive summary. Speak directly to them, acknowledging what their lifestyle data and voice indicators suggest about their current stress load. Do not use medical or diagnostic terminology.
5. "recommendations": array of actionable wellness, emotional regulation, and grounding techniques.

Important: Maintain an immensely empathetic, supportive, and human tone. Read between the lines of what their lifestyle data indicates relative to their physical vocal cues. Never claim to be a doctor or use words like 'diagnose', 'patient', 'treatment', or 'clinic'.`,
